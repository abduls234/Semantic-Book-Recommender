# Semantic-Book-Recommender

A smart book recommendation platform that leverages a fine-tuned language model and semantic search to provide personalized and relevant book suggestions based on user queries.

## Overview

This project implements a semantic book recommender system that understands the meaning behind user input and retrieves the most relevant books from a large collection. It combines:

- **Fine-tuned language model** to better capture domain-specific knowledge and improve recommendation quality.
- **Semantic search using embeddings and vector similarity** to find books closely related to user interests.
- **A vector database** to efficiently index and search book descriptions.
- An intuitive interface for querying and receiving recommendations.

## Features

- Fine-tuned model trained on book descriptions and user preferences.
- Text embedding with state-of-the-art models to represent book content.
- Fast vector similarity search with FAISS.
- Context-aware recommendations leveraging semantic understanding.
- Easy integration for web or desktop applications.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
